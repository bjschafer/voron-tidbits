# Voron Tidbits

This repo contains thing(s) I've created or unearthed that are useful when doing Voron things.

## `generate-csv.sh`

This script is run against a tree of STLs as found in many of the Voron repos. It spits out a CSV in a useful-ish format
designed to be imported into GSheets or Excel.

Requirements: `bash`, GNU `awk`.
